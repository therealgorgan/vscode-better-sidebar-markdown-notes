## ðŸ“¥ Importing Notes

### From the Old Extension

If you're migrating from the original `sidebar-markdown-notes` extension:

1. **Automatic Recovery**: The extension automatically scans for and recovers your old notes
2. **Multiple Recovery Methods**:
   - Scans VSCode's global storage locations
   - Checks workspace `.vscode` folders for backup files
   - Looks for common export file names
   - Searches multiple possible data formats
3. **Seamless Import**: Old notes appear directly in the import dialog - no manual steps needed!

### From Markdown Files

Import existing markdown files from your workspace:

1. Click the "Import Notes" button in the sidebar
2. The extension will scan your workspace for `.md` files
3. Select which files you want to import
4. Handle any conflicts (skip, replace, or merge)
5. Your notes will be imported and ready to use

### Supported Formats

- Standard Markdown files (`.md`, `.markdown`)
- Old extension JSON format
- Multiple pages from single files
- Task lists and checkboxes
- Code blocks and formatting
